**Project Overview:**

In this data analytics project, I delved into the Amazon Movie and TV Shows dataset to uncover insights and trends within the entertainment industry. Through a comprehensive analysis comprising over 50 queries, I conducted extensive data exploration to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and provide valuable insights into various aspects of the movies and TV shows available on Amazon.

The two tables that I used were the titles and the credits table.
The titles table had attributes like the title of the show, imdb ratings, production country, imdb votes, age certification of the show.
