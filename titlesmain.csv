It was unprecedented in daytime television when ghosts were introduced about six months after it began.The series became hugely popular when vampire Barnabas Collins appeared a year into its run. Dark Shadows also featured werewolves, zombies, man-made monsters, witches, warlocks, time travel, and a parallel universe. A small company of actors each played many roles indeed, as actors came and went, some characters were played by more than one actor. Major writers besides Art Wallace included Malcolm Marmorstein, Sam Hall, Gordon Russell, and Violet Welles.Dark Shadows was distinguished by its vividly melodramatic performances, atmospheric interiors, memorable storylines, numerous dramatic plot twists, unusually adventurous music score, and broad and epic cosmos of characters and heroic adventures. Now regarded as something of a classic, it continues to enjoy an intense cult following. Although the original series ran for only five years, its scheduling as a daily daytime drama allowed it to amass more single episodes during its run than most other science-fictionfantasy genre series produced for English-language television, including Doctor Who and the entire Star Trek television franchise.

Vic falls for gorgeous blonde Wendy (Carol Lynley). The films title refers to the name of his speakeasy, and to his gang, which consists of himself, Wendy, and a brace comic-relief hoodlums.

Expecting some wit upon seeing the name Don Martin in the credits will drive you stark raving nuts - this is not the cartoonist who worked for Mad magazine.

It was hosted originally by Steve Burns, who left in 2002 to pursue a music career, and later by Donovan Patton. Burns was a crucial reason for the shows success, and rumors that surrounded his departure were an indication of the shows emergence as a cultural phenomenon. Blues Clues became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on American commercial television and was crucial to Nickelodeons growth. It has been called one of the most successful, critically acclaimed, and ground-breaking preschool television series of all time. A spin-off called Blues Room premiered in 2004.The shows producers and creators presented material in narrative format instead of the more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young childrens viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. They revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers involvement. Research was part of the creative and decision-making process in the production of the show, and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blues Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers, and resembled a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting was familiar to American children, but had a look unlike other childrens TV shows. A live production of Blues Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the shows creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.",1996,TV-Y,25,"animation, comedy, family",US,7,tt0163929,6.9,6187,37.565,7.789
